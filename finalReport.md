# Capstone Project Rossmann Sales Prediction
## Definition



### Project Overview
Sales prediction is 

### Problem Statement
Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. More percisly, the target outputs are sales prediction for each day, and can up to six weeks long. As state before, this sales can be influenced by many factor, and those data can work together, to help identify the future sales figure.

To solve this issue, a machine learning model will be build to fullfil this tasks. Candidate model including general supervised lerning model such as SGD Regressor, Lasso, EnsembleRegressors, XGBoost, as well as RNN. Decision will be made after exploring and engineering of data.
